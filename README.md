## About The Project

This project is part of the final assessment for the Machine Learning module at Gisma University of Applied Sciences. In
this project, I downloaded the Shark Attacks dataset from Kaggle, which was really small and messy. In the first phase,
I tried to clean the data and approached specific tasks for each column to reduce the number of rows deleted. Next, I
plotted feature distributions and applied some feature engineering techniques to make the dataset more readable for
machines. Finally, I applied machine learning methods and evaluated the dataset against the chosen method.

## Result

In this project, I used a Jupyter notebook to run the whole pipeline. The final report is saved as an HTML file named '
final-report-GH1033801.html' in this repository. Also, the best model and the cleaned dataset are saved in this
repository.
